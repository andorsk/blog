# About this Blog

Hi, I'm [Andor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/henosisknot/) and this is my blog. I
post about random engineering things I'm finding interesting at the time.
Generally, my focus will be on identity, as that's what my current company is
focused on, but I may dabble in ML and standard engineering optimization at some
points.
